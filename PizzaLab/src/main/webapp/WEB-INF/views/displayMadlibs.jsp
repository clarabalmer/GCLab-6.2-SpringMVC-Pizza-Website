		 homework was due to ${verb1} it.
		She knew it would be a lot of ${noun1}, but she had 
		${adj1} ${noun2} to work on over the ${time2} and that couldn't be helped.
		She gathered her ${drink} and ${food}, put on a lofi ${music} playlist,
		and started to ${verb2} on her ${pie} pie website. Just when she started to 
		${verb3} Spring MVC, she fell ${mind} at her computer. In her dreams
		she ${verb4} a pizza ${business} with a ${adj2} name. She served specialty ${noun3}
		with ${noun4} on them, pizza in the shape of a ${noun5}, and
		pizza for ${noun6}. Everyone ${verb5} her pizza and came from ${noun7} around to 
		see if it was really as ${adj3} as it looked on the ${noun8}. 
		When she woke up, she ${adverb1} submitted her ${noun9} and waited for her
